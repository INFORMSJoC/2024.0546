In this folder, we show the numercial results on the coauthor model introduced in Jackson & Wolinsky (1996).

# Setup
We consider problems with 5 agents. We set different levels of cost c for connection. 
For each value of c, we randomly generate 20 starting
points and apply LogTP to the co-author model.

In Figure 2 and 3, we show pairwise stable networks at c = 0.4 and c = 0.3, respectively.
