In this folder, we show the numerical results of the coauthor model introduced by Jackson & Wolinsky (1996). (in Section 5.1 of our paper)

# Setup
We consider problems with 5 agents. We set different levels of cost c for connection. 
For each value of c, we randomly generate 20 starting
points and apply LogTP to the co-author model.

In Figure 2 and 3, we show pairwise stable networks at c = 0.4 and c = 0.3, respectively.
