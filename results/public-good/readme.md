In this folder, we show the numercial results on the public good provision model of Bramoulle & Kranton (2007).

For each n (scale of problem), we generate 20 random problems. For n larger than 10, DAE cannot solve  

The file `6.xlsx`, `8.xlsx` and `10.xlsx` report the comparison result of LogTP and DAE when there are 6, 8 and 10 agents respectively.

The rest files report the comparison result of LogTP and ALogTP.
