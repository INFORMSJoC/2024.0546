In this folder, we show the numercial results on the patent race model introduced in Goyal & Joshi (2006) and Bich & Morhaim (2020).

# Setup
We consider problems with 3 firms. In the numerical experiment, we assume there are two homogenuous firms (k1 = k2 = 2) and consider a series of problems generated by
k3 increasing from 2 to 6 with a step size of 0.02. For each problem, we randomly generate 20 starting points to find pairwise stable networks. 

We find that:

when 2.00<=k<=3.92, the complete network is the unique pairwise stable network.

when 3.94<=k<= 4.54, there are two pairwise stable networks (1,1,0) and (1,0,1).

when 4.56<=k<=6.00, a unique pairwise stable network (1,0,0) exists.

Figure 4 illustrates how k3 affects T in patent race networks, where T represents the expected innovation time of the whole society.
