This `results` folder contains the numerical results of algorithms mainly reported in Section 5 of the paper. 
1. `co-author`: algorithm `LogTPm` for the co-author model introduced in Jackson & Wolinsky (1996), reported in Section 5.1.
2. `patent-race`: algorithm `LogTPc` for the patent race network problem introduced in Goyal & Joshi (2006) and Bich & Morhaim (2020), reported in Section 5.2.
3. `connections`: the comparison between algorithms `LogTPm` and `Comp/LinTP` for the connections model introduced in Jackson & Wolinsky (1996), reported in Section 5.3.
4. `public-good`: the comparison among algorithms `LogTPm`, `Comp/DaE` and `Comp/ALogTP` for the public good provision network problem introduced in Bramoulle and Kranton (2007), reported in Section 5.4.
5. `Convergence to LinTP`: an example that shows the convergence of LogTP to LinTP as η approaches 0, summarized in Figure 1.
