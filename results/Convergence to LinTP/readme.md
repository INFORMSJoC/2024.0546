This folder contains the data used in Figure 1, which shows that LogTP converges to LinTP as η approaches 0.
The figures are produced in the connections model of Jackson & Wolinsky (1996) with n = 3, w = [1, 2, 3], d = 0.5, c = 0.48 and σ = p = 0.5 · 1.

# Replication
To derive Figure 1, one can use the codes in `plot1.m`.
