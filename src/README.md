This 'src' folder contains codes of five algorithms for computing pairwise stable networks. 
1. an algorithm for problems that agents all have concave and differentiable utility functions, used in Section 5.2 of the paper.
2. an algorithm for problems of mixed-extension, agents all have multi-linear utility functions, used in Section 5.1 of the paper.
3. the algorithm of Herings & Zhan (2024), used in Section 5.3 for comparison.
4. the algorithm of Leung (2020), used in Section 5.4 for comparison.
5. the accelerated version of our algorithm that exploits the algorithm of Leung (2020), used in Section 5.4 of the paper.
