In this folder, we show the version of LogTPm applied to a connections model of Jackson & Wolinsky (1996), discussed in Section 5.3. In this version, we assume the agents are located on a circle and adjust the codes in `links.m`, `graphs.m` and `values.m` accordingly. (We rename them by `loop_link.m`, `loop_graph.m` and `loop_values'.)
