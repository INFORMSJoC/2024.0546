In this folder, we show the version of LogTPm applied to a connections model of Jackson & Wolinsky (1996), discussed in Section 5.3. In this version, we assume the agents are located on a circle. Therefore, we also adjust the codes in `link.m`, `graphs.m` and `values.m` and rename these files ("loop_***").
