# Manual for LinTP
LinTP is the algorithm of Herings & Zhan (2024) that computes pairwise stable networks in problems of mixed-extension where agents all have multi-linear utility functions. This algorithm handles problems with a sparse structure.
Herings & Zhan (2024) establish the equivalent between pairwise stable networks and Nash equilibria of certain noncooperative games. They then apply the linear tracing procedure
of Harsanyi & Selten (1988) to make the selection and computation.

We compare LinTP with our algorithm LogTP in Section 5.3 of our paper upon a connections model of Jackson & Wolinsky (1996).
