% robust_links: to figure out the robust link
% Input: N, number of players; other parameters in the model. Take the public provision model of BramoullÂ´e and
% Kranton (2007) as an example. (in Section 5.4 of our paper) e, the effort
% vector; d > 0, cost for links.
% Output: two N*N matrices M and D. A link ij is surely to be absent if
% Mij = 0 or Mji = 0. This link is sure to be established if Dij = 0 and Dji = 0.
